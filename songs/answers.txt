If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

By looking at the average energy,valence and danceability of the user's data, I would say that the user is very entertaining,energetic and confident. So, I would conclude that the user has Purple aura

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

If the aura i calculated doesn't represent the listener then i propose the idea of calculating aura not only from their energy, valence and danceability but also from their color choices and also calculating songs average between very agressive or energetic to very peaceful or calm.
